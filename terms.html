    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: February 17, 2026</p>

    <p>These terms govern your use of Cue, the AI-powered family management service operated at hicue.ai. By using Cue, you agree to these terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Cue is a family operating system that helps households manage schedules, events, and budgets through SMS, email, and a web dashboard. Cue uses artificial intelligence to parse, organize, and respond to your messages.</p>

    <h2>2. Account and Access</h2>
    <p>Each family account is managed by one or more admins (typically parents). Admins are responsible for adding family members and contacts, managing permissions, and ensuring the accuracy of information in Cue. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account.</p>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use Cue only for lawful, personal family management purposes. You may not use Cue to send spam, harass others, or transmit harmful content. You may not attempt to access another family's data or circumvent any security measures.</p>

    <h2>4. AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>Cue uses AI to interpret messages and generate responses. While we strive for accuracy, AI-generated content may contain errors. Cue provides tools for admins to review and correct AI interpretations. You should verify important information (event times, financial figures) before relying on it.</p>

    <h2>5. Messaging and Consent</h2>
    <p>By using Cue, you consent to receive SMS messages at the phone number associated with your account. Standard messaging rates from your carrier may apply. You may stop receiving messages at any time by texting STOP to your family's Cue number or by contacting us.</p>

    <h2>6. Subscription and Payment</h2>
    <p>Cue offers both free and paid subscription tiers. Pricing, features, and billing terms will be communicated at the time of purchase. We reserve the right to change pricing with 30 days notice.</p>

    <h2>7. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of Cue is also governed by our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. You retain ownership of all data you provide to Cue. We do not sell your data.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Cue is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for missed events, scheduling conflicts, inaccurate financial summaries, or any other losses arising from use of the service. Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid for the service in the prior 12 months.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may cancel your account at any time. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms. Upon termination, you may request an export of your data.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of Cue after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. We will notify you of material changes via SMS or the Command Center.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these terms, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@hicue.ai">support@hicue.ai</a>.</p>
